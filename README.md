# TypesOfPollutionAndItsEffectOnHumanBody(computer-graphics)
This project will demonstrate the types of pollutions on environment, and then depict its effect on a human body. 
A 3-Dimensional model of a Human Body is displayed on a Main rectangular window at the center of the Screen. The model rotates at its axis. Different types of pollution are displayed on different windows. Pollution Scenes and model are created and manipulated using OpenGLâ€™s prominent functions: Primitive, Control & Viewing Functions. Each Sub-Window is located at each corner of the screen. Scene in each Window animates to show how that respective Pollution happens. Effect of respective pollution on human body is highlighted on the model. Rotation function is used to make Model Rotate at its axis. Suitable colors are applied to differentiate the primitives.
We make use OpenGL for the whole coding purpose. The OpenGL utility Toolkit is a programming interface with ANSI C for writing window system independent OpenGL programs. The toolkits support many functionalities like: multiple window rendering, call-back driven event processing, sophisticated input devices, etc.
